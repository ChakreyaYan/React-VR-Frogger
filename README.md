# :frog: Frogger-React-VR

This is a work-in-progress and proof-of-concept project. The goal is to recreate Frogger using [React VR](https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/).

## Installation

Download the project. Run `yarn` in the project directory. Run `yarn start` to run the app in development mode. Navigate to `localhost:8081/vr/` in your browser to see it in action.

Alternatively, access the development server from your phone by opening `192.168.1.100:8081/vr/index.html` if your local IP is `192.168.1.100`. If you are running this project on a Mac or Linux machine and do not know your local IP, you can run `ifconfig` in your terminal. Look for an IP that matches `192.169.1.*`.
